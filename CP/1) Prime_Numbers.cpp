/*
some facts about prime numbers

1)2 is the only even prime

2)every prime can be written as 6n+1(or)6n-1(where n is a natural number), except 2 and 3
for example:
6 * 2 - 1 = 11(prime)

3)Goldbach conjecture: Every even integer greater than 2
can be expressed as the sum of 2 primes
for example:
13 + 3 = 16(even integer)

4)2 and 3 are only consecutive numbers that are prime

5)wilson's theorem => (p-1)! = (p-1) mod p
(should be explained briefly)

/*
wilson's theorem is 
(p-1)! = (p-1) % p

now what is the significance of the theorem?

if p=5
then 
(5-1)! = (5-1) % 5 
    4! = 4 % 5
    4! = 4
 (25)%5 = 4
    4 = 4

//what is prime number?
//a number should be divisible by 1 & itself 
//and no of factors of that number=2
